Reddit's users and bots are all constrained by Karma, which is a system of points that users accumulate over time through positive communication on the site. A user that has no karma, or very little, will be throttled (down to one contribution per 10 minutes, or varying limits depending on the subreddit) if they try to contribute excessively. For this reason, a bot, like a user, needs to build up karma before it can contribute freely. 

<p>If your bot was registered under a brand new account, you should spend some time using that account to comment and participate on Reddit to make sure that it won't be hampered in its duties. A good way to build karma quickly is to comment on "rising" submissions in very active subreddits like askReddit or pics.<p>

Another important note is that individual subreddits have different attitudes toward bots. Some will ban your bot outright the first time it makes a post, while others will give your bot some time to establish itself, but may ban it if users report it for being spam-like or annoying. 
<p>The best thing you can do to make sure your bot lives a long life is to consult the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette">reddiquette</a> and commenting guidelines for every subreddit in which your bot is active. Make a bot that is useful and polite, and you'll find that your creation will be welcome in most places.
<p>
		Now that we've covered the caveats, so let's run and test our bot!
