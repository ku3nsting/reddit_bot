		Most Reddit bots are designed to automate a single process or a sequence of processes. There are bots that respond to comments that include a specific string, bots that upvote and downvote submissions (frowned upon), and bots that provide utilities for users, like the AI image colorizer <a href=http://www.whatimade.today/two-weeks-of-colorizebot-conclusions-and-statistics/>Colorizebot</a>.  
		<p>
		For this example, we will create a bot that reads and writes comments within a specific subreddit.
		<p>
		My bot concept is called The Jelly Fox bot, and is based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92DtMHUEeaw">a Noel Fielding comedy sketch</a> in which an entity called "The Jelly Fox" gives people what they need in life (similar to the Wizard of Oz). My bot will listen for strings in comments where users express needs, and make comments delivering on those needs if possible.
		<p>
		Before you begin making your bot, you should decide the following things:
		<ul>
		<li>The bot's name</li>
		<li>Its (desired) mechanism of action</li>
		<li>Its scope (where will it operate? How often will it appear?)</li>
		<p>
		Now that we've designed our bot, we need to make it official with Reddit!
