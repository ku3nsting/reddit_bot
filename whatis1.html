		An API is an Application Programming Interface. Some companies build them for internal use, and some build them in such a way that they are useful to their userbase. 
		<p>
		An API is part of a website's remote server. It's the part of the server that receives requests (for data) and sends responses (that, in our case, get interpreted by the browser and displayed or used).
		<p>
		When we build an application that can talk to <a href=https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/>Reddit's API</a>, what we're doing is requesting that Reddit's server give us some specific information or perform some specific action.
		<p>
		The API is being expanded all the time, but currently there are methods to interact with the following Reddit features:
		<ul>
		<li>User and Moderator account metadata</li>
		<li>Captchas</li>
		<li>User flair and subreddit-specific flair</li>
		<li>Reddit gold</li>
		<li>Posts (links and text)</li>
		<li>Comments</li>
		<li>Private messages</li>
		
		<li>And many more!</li>
		</ul>
		
		Because the API is part of a server owned by Reddit, and because using it allows you to interact with the website, you can only use the API if you register with Reddit first, and follow their terms of use. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api#wiki_reddit_api_access">The Reddit wiki entry about the API</a> is a good place to get an overview of the rules, but I will point them out as we progress through the tutorial.
		<p>
		Now you know what the API is, so let's figure out what to do with it!
