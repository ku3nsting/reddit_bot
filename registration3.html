		All bots that are active on Reddit need to be registered with the site, otherwise, for security reasons, they won't be able to sucessfully interact with the API. 
		<p>
		Even if you are a user of Reddit already, I suggest that you create a new user account for your bot. Do this by clicking the "Log in or Sign up" link in the top-right corner of the site, then by filling in your credentials in the subsequent dialog, which looks like this:

		<p>
		Once you have logged into your account, click preferences > apps > create an app. Use the provided form to name your bot and describe its purpose. 
		<p>
		For our learning purposes, we'll choose the "script" option for our application type. For scripts, it doesn't matter what you provide for redirect and about urls, so you can use an arbitrary page, like a github repository owned by you.
		<p>
		Following these steps, you should end up with an application admin page much like the following:

 <p>
		You will notice that Reddit has generated a unique ID string and a "secret" for your bot. You use this secret to communicate with the Reddit API the fact that your bot is legitimate and has been registered. For my bot, the ID is mwIDSk_NS7wdfA and the secret is e20oW7onHksbD8qWBXkwzNfhYNQ.

		<p>
		Now that we've registered our bot, we need to make some decisions about how we will develop it!
